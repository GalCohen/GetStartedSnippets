Getting Started Snippets
======

Over the years I've collected snippets of code from tutorials, videos and playing around with different languages.

They aren't always examples of best practices, nor are they complete or cover every language and framework I use. Some are from codecademy.com lessons, thenewboston.com, and udacity. 
But whenever I'm following video tutorials, reading an article or just throwing together something qiuck, they end up
becoming quite handy. Plus, it's nice to look back and where I started with some of these languages and where my abilities progressed to now.
